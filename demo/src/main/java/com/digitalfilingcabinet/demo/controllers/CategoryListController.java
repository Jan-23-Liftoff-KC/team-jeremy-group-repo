    // this thing should render a table showing all the categories that are created
    // can we get this thing to like, also show a thumbnail of the category
    // and then, like, show a list that they can click on to render a thumbnail of a different one
    // and then a button on the thumbnail to take them to a new page with the full view
    // of the category, and the upload/edit functions.

    // thats probably a 'parking lot' idea, we can start with this simply rendering the
    // full category list.

    //do we need a category editor controller that has a conditional that only role= admin || editor can access or
    //should that be included within this controller?
