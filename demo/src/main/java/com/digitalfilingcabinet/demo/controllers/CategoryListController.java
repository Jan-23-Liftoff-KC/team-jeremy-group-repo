    // and then, like, show a list that they can click on to render a thumbnail of a different one
    // and then a button on the thumbnail to take them to a new page with the full view
    // of the category, and the upload/edit functions.

    // thats probably a 'parking lot' idea, we can start with this simply rendering the
    // full category list.
